# Chemsus-Robot
Chemsus-Robot (also sometimes called 'Robot Chemsus', or just, 'Chemsus') is a discord bot written using the `discord.py` API, this bot was made specifically for the [chemsus's church](https://discord.gg/mVhqcbqVNH) discord server and is in constant development by a few teenagers who only kinda know what they're doing. 
###### _(so it's about as stable as a suspention bridge made of yarn and chewing gum)_
### TODO
- add a react-role system
- add a gpt conversation system
- compartmentalize using `discord.ext.commands.cogs`
- better exception handling
